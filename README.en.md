Billing season and account balance for the DeepSeek Harness web GUI. A pill in the
composer's statistics row, immediately after the native **Cache hit** reading, that
opens a small panel with the full picture.

```
2288M tok · Cache hit 99.8% · ● Off-peak · 2h13m
```

![The pill in the composer statistics row and the panel it opens](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devacc8/dsh-billing-badge/main/docs/preview.png)

## What it shows

| Where | What |
|---|---|
| The pill | a coloured dot (amber for peak, green for off-peak), the season, and the time until it flips |
| The panel (click) | billing season, next switch with the Beijing wall clock, current Beijing time, account balance with its currency, the granted and topped-up split when the account has one, and a refresh button |

The season rule is the published one: peak is Beijing time, Monday to Friday,
09:00-12:00 and 14:00-18:00. Everything else, including all of Saturday and Sunday,
is off-peak at half price.

## The balance

The numbers come from the official `GET /user/balance` endpoint, and the three of them
mean different things:

```
total_balance = granted_balance + topped_up_balance
```

- `total_balance`, shown as **Account balance**, is everything you can spend.
- `granted_balance`, shown as **Granted**, is credit DeepSeek gave you. The endpoint
  reports only the part that has not expired, so a lapsed grant disappears from this
  row on its own.
- `topped_up_balance`, shown as **Topped up**, is money you paid in.

The panel names the two parts only when the account is actually split. With no grant the
topped-up amount is the whole balance, so the split would repeat the account balance row
above it, and that account shows one row instead. **Granted** appears as soon as the
endpoint reports one.

`is_available` is a top-level field of the response and answers one question: is the
balance enough for API calls. The panel adds a warning row when the answer is no, and
stays quiet otherwise, because the flag is true for every funded account.

The currency is taken from the response, never assumed: an account reporting USD is
not labelled with a CNY sign.

## Why another one

Two community plugins cover parts of this, and both taught something:

- [dsh-price-phase](https://github.com/lijunyu726/dsh-price-phase) shows the season.
  Its countdown once pointed at Saturday 09:00 after Friday close, an event that does
  not happen, and it centres its badge on a hashed CSS class, which collides with the
  model chip when the model name is long. This plugin compares each candidate boundary
  with the instant before it and only counts a real state flip, and its chip is an
  ordinary flex child in the native statistics row.
- [dsh-usage-monitor](https://github.com/liyiersan/dsh-usage-monitor) shows the
  balance, but formats it as CNY whatever the API reports.

This plugin deliberately does **not** do cost or token accounting.

## Install

From npm:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-billing-badge
```

or straight from the repository:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add github:devacc8/dsh-billing-badge
```

then restart `dsh web`. The package declares `dsh.bundle.patch`, so the host half is
reconciled into the profile's bundle list automatically.

Works on DeepSeek Harness 0.1.5 and 0.1.6. Older builds render the composer statistics
as one labelled row and the chip joins it; 0.1.6 moved those readings into the composer
dock as pill buttons, and the chip follows the cache-hit pill into that row.

Working on the plugin itself, install the checkout by path instead:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add link:/absolute/path/to/dsh-billing-badge
```

## Security

A balance is a small surface, so it stays small:

- the API key is resolved in the host through the DSH credentials seam
  (`ctx.credentials.resolve('DEEPSEEK_API_KEY')`, environment fallback) and never
  reaches the browser;
- the single route requires the `x-dsh-billing-badge: 1` header and rejects a
  cross-origin `Origin`, so a cross-site page cannot reach it;
- nothing is written to disk, and no endpoint other than `api.deepseek.com` is
  contacted;
- a missing key, an HTTP error or a network failure all degrade to a state the panel
  renders, never to a throw.

## Development

The season logic lives in `lib/season.js` as a plain ESM module so it can be tested
directly. A browser bundle cannot import a sibling file (the loader resolves only
platform seeds, materialized packages and registered factories, and a self-subpath
`require` throws "missed the module table"), so `scripts/inline-season.mjs` copies the
module into `lib/client.js` between two markers with `export ` stripped, and
`test/client-sync.test.mjs` fails if the copy drifts.

```sh
npm test          # 30 tests: season rule, countdown invariant, host route, bundle
npm run sync      # re-inline season.js into the bundle
npm run check     # sync check plus a syntax check of both halves
```

The countdown has an invariant test rather than fixtures: every 13 minutes across nine
days, the reported target must be in the future, must change the season, and the
season must not change before it.

## Layout

```
lib/season.js    season rule, countdown, formatting (source of truth, tested)
lib/index.js     host half: the balance route
lib/client.js    browser half: the pill and its panel, with season.js inlined
cordis.patch.yml mounts the host half into the profile
scripts/         the inliner
test/            season, sync, host and bundle tests
```

GitHub Actions runs `npm test` and `npm run check` on Node 20 and 22.
